## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-rc.2] - 2025-01-25

### ðŸ”§ Fixes

#### Packaging Improvements

- **Fixed Husky execution on install**: Script `prepare` now checks for `.git` directory before running Husky, preventing execution when the package is installed from npm
- **Updated Husky hooks**: Removed deprecated `#!/usr/bin/env sh` and `. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"` lines from pre-commit and commit-msg hooks
- **Updated prepare script**: Fixed to work with Husky v9 by using `npx husky` instead of deprecated `.install()` method
- **Removed auto-dependency**: Cleaned up self-reference in dependencies that could cause installation loops
- **Removed duplicate dependencies**: Eliminated duplicate `@hapi/boom` entry in devDependencies

#### Code Quality

- **Better error messages**: Improved error handling in prepare script
- **Cleaner dependencies**: Removed unnecessary packages (`install`, `npm`) from dependencies

### ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
npm install @luoarch/baileys-store-core@1.0.0-rc.2
# or
yarn add @luoarch/baileys-store-core@1.0.0-rc.2
```

**Breaking Changes:** None

**Migration from 1.0.0-rc.1:** Automatic - no code changes required

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2025-01-25

### ðŸŽ‰ First Release Candidate

This is the first release candidate for v1.0.0. We're seeking community feedback before the stable release.

#### Features

- âœ… Hybrid storage architecture (Redis + MongoDB)
- âœ… Circuit breaker resilience with Opossum
- âœ… Transactional outbox pattern for dual-write consistency
- âœ… Thread-safe Prometheus metrics
- âœ… Deep Buffer Revival algorithm for Baileys v7.0+ compatibility
- âœ… Mutex-based concurrency control
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite (49 tests: unit + integration + E2E)
- âœ… **Enhanced CryptoService security** with configurable logging and validation

#### Security Improvements

- âœ… **Configurable logging** - Debug logs only in development with explicit flags
- âœ… **Data sanitization** - Removed sensitive data (keyId, nonce hex, key previews) from logs
- âœ… **Input validation** - Added ciphertext size validation (minimum 16 bytes for auth tag)
- âœ… **Buffer normalization** - Unified handling of Buffer, Uint8Array, JSON, and Base64 formats
- âœ… **Production safety** - Prevents temporary keys in production environment
- âœ… **Constants-based** - Eliminated magic numbers with documented cryptographic constants

#### Known Limitations

- MongoDB versions < 5.0 not tested
- Redis Cluster support experimental
- Performance benchmarks on single-node only

#### Feedback Requested

- Production deployment testing
- Multi-region MongoDB/Redis setups
- Edge case scenarios with Baileys v7.0+
- Performance metrics in your environment

**Breaking Changes:** None (first release)

**Migration Guide:** N/A (first release)
